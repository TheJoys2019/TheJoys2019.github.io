Stream Wars: Attack of The Clones! 
Should Netflix Be Afraid Of Competition?

We take a glimpse into the world of online video streaming, the long days of walking into a Blockbuster Videos are long gone and the age of online video streaming has taken off with fierce competition ahead. We delve into the history of Netflix's Earning Reports from Each Quarter Year Over Year trying to analyze how long it took for the streaming giant to achieve pole position and if the competition should alarm Mr. Reed Hastings. I'll take you through the subscriber growth and show you how correlated it is with the share price and how subscriber growth wasn't the only reason the stock price ballooned north of the wall.
